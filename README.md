*layouts* is a TypeScript library that allows web developers to create complex user interfaces in HTML5

WPF/SL are great libraries for creating UI for desktop and web applications that introduced a number of powerful paradigms I couldn't find in any other JavaScript/TypeScript library out there.
*layouts* can be an ideal start for those applications that need to be ported from Silverlight to HTML5 but is flexible enough for build most of projects that require complex user interfaces (like dashboards, graphical designers, single page apps). This means that it's not a "general purpose" framework for every kind of web application.
